In honor of National Poetry Month (and Earth Day!), I’ve selected a poetry sampler that captures the range and push into the horizon of what I hope to bring to Orion’s poetry offerings each issue.

Some of the poems are loud and boisterous in their joy. Others are more contemplative, urging a look into the mirror to see what could be done for our planet. But this is just a sampling—pull up a chair, dig in, do some gardening in this poetry field. If you come across one or three that move you, consider sharing with a friend or handwriting it out in a journal. Perhaps these selections might even make you pick up a pen or grab your laptop and tease out a few poems yourself.

Happy National Poetry Month from all of us here at Orion.
